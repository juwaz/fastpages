## learning deep learning

Today I'll be reviewing Jeremy Howard's deep learning for coders resource project as well 
as the topic of Artificial Intelligence broadly.

## ai curious 

Artificial Intelligence has piqued my interest of late as it's beginning to play
a meaningful role in various fields including those most familiar to me,
information security and DevOps. As such I took some time to seek out quality
resources to get better versed on the subject and stumbled upon Jeremy Howard's
(kaggle co-founder and current AI startup CEO) training courses for getting
technical folks quickly up to speed on A.I.

## approachable goldilocks diet

I found them to be approachable even for those with zero deep learning
experience, well-organized, and with a perfect balance of
theory, practice, and real-world applications. With this class Jeremy has managed to
foster a diverse and highly engaged open-source community that is singular
in nature across various aspects. I only have good things to say about the course and it's become a goto recommendation
to my peers.

## the philistine

There is a biblical parable where Jesus Christ extends clemency to those
bringing him to the cross saying ... "Forgive them, for they know not what they
do", in artificial intelligence I believe "we" as a broader technical community 
could be seen as "philistines" with respect to bringing about a swathe of A.I. centered 
changes to society with unexpected and dire consequences. 
Experts agree with some remarking that we could be "summoning the beast". At the
moment artificial intelligence applications and resources over-index on novelty
and value but what happens when eventual misuses of the technology and research
causes society to question the source and veracity of text and digital media as
well as the criterium used by neural networks that play a key role in the decision making
process for various technical applications. I don't have the answers but
continue to seek out balanced critical analysis and in the meantime enjoy the
products of the OpenAI research project as well as various this __ _blank_ does not exist
applications.
