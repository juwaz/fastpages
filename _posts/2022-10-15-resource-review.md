# black hills infosec rocks

## time and money meet mouth

This is a quick post reviewing John Strand's Black Hills information security
community resource project. His time is obviously valuable but he is investing
it and other resources to further his goals of making the historically expensive
and often opaque process of establishing a career in information technology and security 
more accessible. 

## pay what you can training, evergreen labs, fun?

Just a few standout points about their offerings are the pay what you can training sessions
which provide access to high quality intro and advanced training subjects with
fees from 0 dollars for those with a self-identified need or a few hundred
dollars for anyone more established. These training sessions are multi-day with
practical expert instruction featuring evergreen labs that are constantly
updated for value and relevance. Most classes also include an ask me anything
session and access to a highly engaged discord channel for during and after
support. The team at BHIS has even taken steps to provide alternating schedules
that are time zone friendly for those in the EU and MENA. Lastly these sessions 
were above all fun, which is far from the norm as I can attest to. 
I thoroughly enjoyed them and will continue to support and recommend black hills offerings.
