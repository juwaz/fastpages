*Hi* I'm Joe Uwazurike an I.T. specialist and aspiring devops security engineer.
This site is a custom fork of **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1] modeled after a robots.txt file as an homage to my path from
digital marketing to systems administration. I'm a curious life-long learner
with a growth mindset and a passion for technology. Thanks for stopping by and
hope to connect soon.
